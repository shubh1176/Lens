# Lens: AI Model Explainability Framework

I am developing Lens, lens is planned to be an advanced, user-friendly tool designed to provide explainability and detailed insights into machine learning models. It supports supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning models with a unified interface.

## Features

### Model Support
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Classification and regression models
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Validation support

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering algorithms
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Clustering metrics (silhouette score, calinski harabasz score)

### Explainers
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Counterfactual Explanations

### Visualization
- Feature importance plots
- Prediction explanation plots
- Clustering visualizations
- Model metrics tracking

### Analysis Tools
- Model debugging
- Drift detection
- Fairness analysis
